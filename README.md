# SoC Driver's License: Learning to Talk to Hardware

## Week 0
Learnt how to built and setup a Linux kernel including any custom modifications to the base kernel.

## Week 1
Learnt about processes, user and kernel mode, traps to the operating system, system calls and a bit of virtual memory. The assignment helped further understand processes, their memory consumption, how to get info on running processes and also build a Loadable Kernel Module to do any changes to our base linux kernel.

## Week 2
Went in depth into system calls. Learnt about the shell and how to use it and how processes/os communicate - Signals. Also went a lot in depth into User and Kernel mode. The assignment allowed me to further understand the inner workings of a shell as I was able to build one myself.

## Week 3
Learnt in depth about virtual/physical memory and popular memory management techniques like Segmentation, Paging etc.
